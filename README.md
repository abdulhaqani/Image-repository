# README
First things first, I have linked my formatted resume and cover letter below. Feel free to ignore the pasted cover letter that was present in my application submission as those ones were not properly formatted.

Things you may want to consider:

- This application renders images from image urls. I was going to a implement a server that saves the images with s3, however, in the end I determined that for the purposes of this app image urls should be good enough.
- For the payment system:
  - use card number 4242 4242 4242 4242, any ccv and a date in the future. The api I am using is their test api so there is no real payments (for obvious reasons, not gonna pay for testing a development application).

- Inventories are updated with each purchase. 

- Only public images can be viewed.

- User functionality and validation was for the most part fully implemented.

- db relationships are mainly done

- Front end is more or less done with some rough spots here and there. (I was under heavy time constraints as I have been occupied with a major family emergency for a little while)

- transactions are saved in the charges model. Fairly simplified model for that one.

- etc
  
I hope you guys like the work I put into this! :)
