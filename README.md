# README
this repo has all of the code for the portfolio app

to view it clone the repo, then run bundle install, then run yarn install --check-files then run rails db:migrate. Then you can view on by running rails server

Things you may want to consider:

- This application renders images from image urls. I was going to a server that saves the images with s3.
- A lot of bases were covered in this app
- Things covered
  - Users
  - Images
  - Transactions (labelled charges)
  - A more or less complete front end
  - validations
  - db relationships 
  - etc ...
  
- Finally, I don't like making excuses but I was blindsided with a major family emergency (dad had a heart attack, and yes thank goodness he's doing okay). I really don't want to bring this up but I know I could do much better. (My time was cut by at least 5 fold)
  
I hope you guys like the work I put into this! :)
